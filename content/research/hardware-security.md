## Open Socure Root of Trust System Hardware [1]

Open Se Cura is built upon an open-source HRoT project called OpenTitan, and it offers several key_contributions:

1) Auditability: the transparency of OpenTitan enables anyone to examine, evaluate, and contribute to its design and documentation, fostering the development of a fully auditable and dependable Silicon RoT. 

2) Flexibility: the modular design of OpenTitan enables seamless integration into diverse hardware environments, including data center servers, storage devices, and peripherals, with minimal system overhead. Additionally, adopters have the option to utilize either open-source or proprietary PDKs and EDA tools to suit their specific requirements.
