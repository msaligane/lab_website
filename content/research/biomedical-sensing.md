## Sensor and Open-Source Silicon Chip for an Affordable and Robust Wearable Sensing System with Precise Temperature, Humidity, and Strain Sensing Capability [[1]](#ref-1)[[2]](#ref-2)

We present the integration of the Laser-Induced-Graphene (LIG) sensors and the Analog Front-End (AFE) chip, all developed using open-source tools which facilitate an affordable prototyping for a multifunctional (temperature, humidity and strain) flexible wearable sensing system.

## Human-Body Communication (HBC) [[3]](#ref-3)

HBC systems use the human body as a conductive medium to transmit data between wearable or implantable devices, reducing radiated energy and improving privacy. A typical HBC link includes body-coupled transmitters and receivers that modulate signals through electrodes and measure the resulting potential differences across the body.
