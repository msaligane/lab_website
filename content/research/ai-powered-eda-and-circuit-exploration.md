## Genetic Alogorithm for Unconventional Circuit Synthesis

We use genetic algorithms to explore unconventional circuit designs across multiple topics, including approximate computing and transistor-level synthesis. By evolving candidate circuits with fitness functions that capture power, accuracy, and area, we can discover non-obvious topologies that traditional flows often miss. This approach lets us search large design spaces quickly while keeping targets and constraints explicit. 

Here shows framework for using genetic algorithm to search for approximate compute circuits.
