Hosted by the Integrated Systems Engineering Laboratory at Kyoto University, this seminar examined what becomes possible when open-source design flows move from research prototypes to reliable, shareable infrastructure.

The conversation emphasized practical adoption: how open flows can lower barriers for new tapeouts while preserving rigor in verification, reproducibility, and long-term maintenance.

## Highlights

- Open design as an enabler for faster prototyping.
- Shared infrastructure for reproducible chip development.
- Balancing openness with verification and reliability.
