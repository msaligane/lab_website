This visit to the Okada Laboratory focused on the theme "AI for Chips and Chips for AI." The talk highlighted how open-source EDA and co-design practices can shorten tapeout cycles while enabling new AI-accelerated systems.

Beyond the main lecture, we discussed how labs and industry partners can share reusable infrastructure to accelerate research translation. The conversation covered reproducible flows, data-driven layout, and how to bring agentic automation into practical chip design.

## Highlights

- Open-source design flows that reduce iteration time.
- Co-design strategies that balance model accuracy, energy, and area.
- Collaboration models that bridge academic research and real-world usability.
