The KAUST Future AI for Chips Forum hosted discussions on the "AI for Chips and Chips for AI", highlighting how automation and open infrastructure can accelerate mixed-signal and AI-accelerator development.

Alongside the forum, the KAUST CEMSE graduate seminar ran in the same time frame, reinforcing the message with a deeper technical focus on agentic layout automation and hardware-software co-design. Together, the sessions connected early architectural choices to time-to-first-token, energy, and silicon cost for edge AI.

## Highlights

- Forum spotlight on AI-enabled EDA workflows and open infrastructure.
- Seminar deep dive into agentic layout, verification, and co-design tradeoffs.
- Emphasis on efficient edge inference through tailored accelerator design.
